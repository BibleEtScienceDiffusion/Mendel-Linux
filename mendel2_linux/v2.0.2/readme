MENDEL Interface Back-end Change Log
----------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.0.2
  - Fix many minor issues with plots in flot
  - Modify diagnostics_selection to allow for super beneficials
  - Make locked area, where features go that are not going to be released
  - Rename new_mutn_per_offspring to mutn_rate
  - Add feature -- all mutations neutral

v2.0.1
  - Changes to start.cgi concerning more explicit indication of 
    number of neutrals.

v2.0.0
  - Make many changes to plot_flot.cgi to completely replace Gnuplot
    as a plotting solution. 

v1.9 Generalize Mendel for small genomes and Prepare to Launch v2.0

v1.9.8
  - Get Mendel to be able to compile using gfortran compiler.
  - This required reverting back to using the Fortran 90 convention 
    for logicals: T/F, rather than 1/0.

v1.9.7
  - added John Baumgardner's latest treatment of synergistic epistasis

v1.9.6
  - output Neutral mutations to hst file and plot in fig 1
  - fix problem running on head node, need to set ppn = num_procs 
    in qsub.pl so multiple parallel jobs can run simultaneously on head node
  - add parameters plot_allele_gens
  - renumber plots, so we don't have plot1a and plot1b,
    remove references to plot numbers in source code...
    so we don't have to keep changing the source code when the 
    interface changes.

v1.9.5
  - make plots using jQuery-based Flot library (flots.cgi)
  - add extinction_threshold as user-input parameter
  - rename plot*.cgi to gnuplot*.cgi
  - set dominant_hetero_expression = 1 when equal effect fitness dist.
  - add temperature monitoring ability... show in list_cases.cgi
  - make non-scaling noise to be 0.05 for 3 of the 4 selection schemes
  - disable the ability to read in parameters from pre-1.9.3 format.
    I thought I could detect older input files from the shorter length
    of the file (<70 lines).  However, some cases post-1.9.3 have
    less than 70 lines, which will give problems when trying to restart
    from a newer case which has an input file less than 70 lines. 

v1.9.4
  - deal with memory issues... add new parameter in config.inc
    max_ram_per_node and change allocated_ram to ram_per_job
  - fix some issues related to equal effect mutation distributions
  - fix read_restart_dump since moving to namelist.input format

v1.9.3
  - convert mendel.in to namelist.input format
  - remove organism_type parameter
  - remove input_file_reader.inc file... always use input_file_parser.inc

v1.9.2
  - includes mods for mendel to be able to run on new Cornell server
  - includes fix to social bonus treatment
  - includes bug fix for back mutation treatment
  - more interface changes
  - includes global statistical analysis of alleles in the case
    of parallel runs

v1.9.1
  - includes bug fix for parallel runs
  - more interface changes

v1.9.0 Generalize Mendel for use with different types of organisms
  - remove tc_scaling_exponent
  - add organism_type parameter
  - change many labels in start interface
  - change haploid_genome_size to genome_size
  - change offspring_per_female to reproductive_rate
  - add fraction_neutrals input box, which effects genome_size, and mutation rate
  - add track_neutrals checkbox
  - move population substructure as separate tab

v1.8.6
- JRB made signicant changes to the way that Mendel handles synergistic epistasis

v1.8.5
- JRB fixed a few problems with previous implementations of group selection:
  * there was a second check in selection() that was resetting the 
    current_pop_size
  * moved where the new current_pop_size was getting computed later
    in the code, after where the new offspring has been generated
  * fixed inconsistencies in the common.h file, where mix-type
    variables were in the same common block

v1.8.4
- use multiplicative model

v1.8.3
- use additive model
- random noise better implementation
- a number of changes to start.cgi

v1.8.2
- fix fertility
- allow fraction_random_death to adjust ...

v1.8.1.2
- correct fraction_selection (instead of 2/3.. should be 1-2/opf)
- correct plot 1b y2axis to be percentage of global pop. size

v1.8.1.1
- let offspring_per_female not drift

v1.8.0
- previous version v1.8.0 has been modified by JRB for him to find 
  problems in group selection
- group selection, don't let offspring_per_female to drift

v1.7 Group Selection Version

v1.7.8
- add HIV template
- JRB fixed bug related to back mutations

v1.7.7
- fix some problems when clonal_reproduction is on, and the 
  bottleneck_pop_size is set to one

v1.7.6
- implement cyclic bottlenecking, when the bottleneck_generation
  is set to a negative value

v1.7.5
- add ability to do back mutations

v1.7.4
- setup start.cgi so that upload mutations dialogue is separate
  than the advanced div and can be turned on either under mutations
  or under the "population substructure" button
- cleaned up coding for group selection by tribal competition
  and checked all changes into CVS repository

v1.7.3
- implement altruistic option
- implement social_bonus_factor

v1.7.2 
- worked with John S. to get tribal competition working correctly

v1.7.1 add group heritability

v1.7.0 upload mutations version
- also added improved ability to randomly generate new case id

v1.6 Tribal Competition Version

v1.6.7 tribal-competition version with attenuation parameter for multiple tribes
- add small nice feature to both list_cases.cgi and list_files.cgi to 
  focus on the search box when the user clicks the "/" ... makes it
  work similar to gmail.com.  Also focus to the search box whenever the 
  user clicks the button on the control panel

v1.6.6 tribal-competition version with attenuation parameter for two tribes
- add grpsel_scaling_exponent as input parameter

v1.6.5 tribal-competition version
- add tribal_competition option to start.cgi, input_file_reader.inc, 
  input_file_parser.inc, input_file_writer.pl, and significant changes
  in mendel.f 
- mendel.f - re-initialize random number generator every generation
- significant mods to plot_recipes.cgi to annotate tribe numbers on 
  plots, plus switch plot 1b to always report population size on y2 axis

v1.6.4 percent heterozygosity version
- include percent heterozygosity analysis. 

v1.6.3 general tribal-death-tolerant version
- initial working version of tribal-death-tolerance for number of tribes
  greater than 2.
- modify qstat.cgi to read mendel.in file and use caseid.001.hst file
  in parallel cases, otherwise use caseid.000.hst file.
- caveats:
   * the status pane on bottom left quits working in the case that
     there are two tribes remaining, and one dies.  in essence,
     the parallel switch is turned off from that point.

v1.6.2
- improve the coding in mpi_migration by grouping MPI wait functions
  and only calling a wait function when required.
- swap Recv and Send statements so that Recv's show up before Sends.

v1.6.1 two-tribe tribal-death-tolerant version
- get tribal death working for two tribes so that either the first
  or the second tribe can die and the other continue 
- also can set one of the tribes to run less number of generations than
  then other
- known problems:
  * when one tribe shuts down the qstat.cgi appears to hang while the
    other tribe waits to finish
- added a $max_tribes variable to config.inc
- modify start.cgi to populate tribe_id select option with the
  number of options consistent with the number of tribes.
  also, enforce that the user cannot specify a number of tribes
  that is greater than max_tribes.
- notes: when running non-homogenous tribes, one will be able to 
  overwrite an old case.  the reason for this is that I must allow
  the user to "rewrite" multiple input files
- add extinction threshold to fit_hst plot

v1.6.0
- pretty much same as v1.5.2

v1.5.2
- initial version of tribal-death-tolerant version of Mendel
  works only for two tribes when the second tribe dies

- fix problem in start.cgi which would allow user to run a case in 
  another user's directory
- improvements and simplification of memory management for parallel cases
  in memory.inc
- considerable changes in memory.inc to automatically detect available
  RAM in Windows versions

v1.4.7
- massive renaming of Perl scripts to adhere to the following 
  conventions
- rename some files such that they logically pair with other
  files to which they are related (e.g. get_data.cgi -> monitor.ajax,
  mpd.cgi -> qmpd.cgi, etc.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE EXTENSION NAMING CONVENTION

While all the back-end script files are executed by Perl
The philosophy of the naming the extensions are by the following
rules:

1) *.cgi extension is used for Perl scripts that create HTML content

2) *.pl files are called secondarily from other *.cgi files
   and do not generate HTML content.  
     
3) *.inc files are required (included) in other .cgi and .pl files
