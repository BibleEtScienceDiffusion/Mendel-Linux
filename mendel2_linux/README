  MENDEL'S ACCOUNTANT LINUX VERSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LINUX version of Mendel's Accountant has been tested on the following
Linux distros: Ubuntu, SuSE, Fedora, and Debian. It should also work on
similar variants such as CentOS and Redhat.

This version has pre-compiled binaries included, so no compilation needs
to be done.

NOTE: There is a bug in the Flot plotting system which causes the plots
not to work correctly on a few Linux distributions.  If this is a problem, 
you may want to try using a different browser, or a different version of 
Linux.  We are working to fix this and release an updated version ASAP.

  ADDITIONAL NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. During installation, this version will ask you how much memory
you want to allow MENDEL to use. If you need to change the amount
of memory which Mendel uses, edit the file:
/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/v2.0/config.inc
and the value of the variable $ram_per_job to the amount of RAM you
have available.  More RAM means larger population sizes, more linkage
blocks, etc.

2. If you already have Mendel installed, you may want to uninstall
before installing a new version.  If you uninstall Mendel, your
data will still remain on your system and you will have access
with the newer version.
